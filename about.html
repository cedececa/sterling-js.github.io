<h2>About Sterling</h2>

<p>Sterling combines Alloy with web-based visualizations, providing both basic Alloy visualization capabilities and a robust platform for the development of domain specific visualizations of Alloy instances.</p>
<p>The idea for a new visualization platform was born from the need to create domain-specific visualizations for models in the field of scientific computing, such as those used to represent <a href='https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/jwb/alloy/'>finite element meshes and sparse matrices</a>. Discussions at the 2018 Workshop on the Future of Alloy then sparked an interest in a web-based visualization platform. Initial ideas were put to the test in an experimental tool called <a href="https://alloy-js.herokuapp.com/">Alloy Instances</a>, which allows users to export XML files from Alloy and develop custom visualizations in the browser. The Alloy Instances tool provides a styling language and sharing platform that is useful for development of visualizations once a model has been completed, but it lacks in utility during the iterative modeling process.</p>
<p>Sterling aims to bridge this gap and further build out the visualization and sharing platforms.</p>
