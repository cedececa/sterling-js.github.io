        <p>The main body of the Sterling user interface is split into three sections. On the left edge of the window is the <strong>sidebar</strong>, which contains buttons that open and close the <strong>drawer</strong>. The drawer is located directly to the right of the sidebar, and contains tools or options corresponding to the button used to open the drawer. Clicking the currently active sidebar button will close the drawer. To the right of the drawer is the <strong>stage</strong>, which displays the currently active view.</p>
        <p>Each view (graph, table, source) contains a unique set of sidebar buttons that appear above the divider. Below the divider are sidebar buttons that are the same in every view; these are used to access <a href='#global+tools'>global tools</a>, such as the evaluator, that are available for use in any view.</p>
