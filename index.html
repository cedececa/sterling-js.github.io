<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Sterling is a web-based visualizer for <a href='http://alloytools.org/'>Alloy</a>, providing enhanced graph and table views in an effort to make instances easier to understand. It is included in a custom build of Alloy, which can be downloaded <a href='/download'>here</a>.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>Sterling combines Alloy with web-based visualizations, providing both basic Alloy visualization capabilities and a robust platform for the development of domain specific visualizations of Alloy instances.</p>
<p>The idea for a new visualization platform was born from the need to create domain-specific visualizations for models in the field of scientific computing, such as those used to represent <a href='https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/jwb/alloy/'>finite element meshes and sparse matrices</a>. Discussions at the 2018 Workshop on the Future of Alloy then sparked an interest in a web-based visualization platform. Initial ideas were put to the test in an experimental tool called <a href="https://alloy-js.herokuapp.com/">Alloy Instances</a>, which allows users to export XML files from Alloy and develop custom visualizations in the browser. The Alloy Instances tool provides a styling language and sharing platform that is useful for development of visualizations once a model has been completed, but it lacks in utility during the iterative modeling process.</p>
<p>Sterling aims to bridge this gap and further build out the visualization and sharing platforms.</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>A demo of Sterling is available <a href='/demo'>here</a>. It includes five sample instances, but you can also load your own by saving an XML file from an instance generated by Alloy (from the Alloy visualizer, click <kbd class='bg-secondary'>File</kbd>&rightarrow;<kbd class='bg-secondary'>Export To</kbd>&rightarrow;<kbd class='bg-secondary'>XML...</kbd>). The only features not available in the demo are the evaluator and the generating of new solutions &mdash; everything else is identical to the Sterling packaged with our custom Alloy build, which you can download <a href='/download'>here</a>.</p>
