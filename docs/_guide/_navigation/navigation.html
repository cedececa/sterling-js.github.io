<p>Sterling, like the Alloy visualizer, displays only a single instance at a time. There are three views which can be used to view and explore the instance data &mdash; graph, table, and source. The graph and table views display the instance data and provide settings and tools that allow you to manipulate how that data is presented. The source view displays the model source code used to generate the current instance.</p>

<div class='row'>
    <div class='col-lg'>
        <img class='img-fluid mb-3' src='/assets/guide/nav.png'>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The navigation bar along the top of the display provides three buttons that allow you to switch between the three views. The <kbd>G</kbd>, <kbd>T</kbd>, and <kbd>S</kbd> keys can also be used to toggle between the graph, tree, and source views respectively. Click the Next button at the right hand side of the navigation bar to request the next solution from Alloy. The command used to generate the current instance is displayed to the left of the Next button.</p>
