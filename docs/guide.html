<h1>User Guide</h1>

<p>This user guide is a comprehensive description of all of Sterling's features, and is a great place to refer back to as you're learning how to use Sterling. The first two sections introduce the layout and navigation of the user interface, and subsequent sections go into the details of the various views and tools. Once you're comfortable using Sterling, you can refer to the <a href='/docs/cheat'>Cheat Sheet</a> when you need a quick refresher on keyboard shortcuts and interactivity.</p>
