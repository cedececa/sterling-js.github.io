{% include h3-anchor.html text="Projections and Node Styling" %}

<p>The <strong>Projections and Node Styling</strong> tools are used to control the visibility and styling of graph nodes. Projecting over an Alloy signature allows you to view the graph from the perspective of specific graph nodes, and is often useful when viewing models that include state change.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Projections</strong> section contains a list of currently active projections, each row showing the <strong>signature</strong>, the currently projected <strong>atom</strong> of that signature, and a set of controls. Click on the current atom to select from a list of all atoms in the signature, or click the <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right</strong> buttons to step back and forth through the atoms. Click on the <strong>X</strong> button to remove the projection.</p>
        <p>Use the <strong>Add Projection</strong> button to add new projections.</p>

        <p>The top half of the <strong>Node Styling</strong> section shows the signature tree of the current instance. Click on a signature to display the styling options for that signature in the bottom half of the section. The <strong>eye</strong> button next to the univ signature can be used to toggle visibility in the tree of signatures that contain no atoms.</p>
        <p>The bottom half of the section shows styling options for the currently selected signature. The <strong>Hide Disconnected Nodes</strong> toggle can be used to toggle visibility of nodes that are not part of any relation.</p>
        <p>All styling attributes that are not explicitly set for a signature will be inherited from that signature's parent.</p>
        <p>Use the <strong>Clear Selected</strong> button to clear styling of the currently selected signature, and use <strong>Clear All</strong> to clear styling for all signatures.</p>
