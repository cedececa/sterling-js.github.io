        <p>Below the navigation bar, the Sterling user interface is split into three section. On the left edge of the display is the <strong>sidebar</strong>, which allows you to access various tools that will be displayed in the <strong>drawer</strong> to the right of the sidebar. Clicking on a sidebar button will open the drawer to display the tool, and clicking it again will close the drawer. The main portion of the display, called the <strong>stage</strong>, is to the right of the drawer and displays the currently active view.</p>

<p>A unique set of tools is provided for each view, and as you toggle between views you'll see the buttons in the sidebar change to reflect the tools available. The buttons above the divider are unique to the currently selected view, while the buttons below the divider are available in all views. You can learn more about the globally available tools in the <a href='#tools'>Tools</a> section.</p>
