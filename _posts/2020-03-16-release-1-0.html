        <p>The Sterling 1.0 release is now available. This version showcases a brand new user interface built using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/">Blueprint</a>. It is very close in functionality to the existing Alloy visualizer with a few major exceptions, which you can read about in the <a href='/tour'>tour</a>.</p>
        <p>Aside from the overhauled interface, the most notable change from the previous version of Sterling is the lack of a tree view; its removal was an intentional decision, as it did not provide any functionality that isn't already present in the Alloy visualizer. Furthermore, the "snapshot" layout previously used in the graph view is no longer available. The graph rendering library has been entirely replaced and it does not yet support compound nodes (but will in an upcoming release).</p>
