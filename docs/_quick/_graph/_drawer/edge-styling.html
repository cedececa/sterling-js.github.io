        <p>The top half of the <strong>Edge Styling</strong> section shows the list of fields in the current instance. Click on a field to display the styling options for that field in the bottom half of the section. The <strong>eye</strong> button next to the Fields label can be used to toggle visibility in the list with no tuples.</p>
        <p>The bottom half of the section shows styling options for the currently selected field. The <strong>Show As Attribute</strong> toggle can be used to display a field as a label of the first atom of every tuple of the relation rather than as edges in the graph.</p>
        <p>All styling attributes that are not explicitly set for a field will be inherited from the default field styles.</p>
        <p>Use the <strong>Clear Selected</strong> button to clear styling of the currently selected field, and use <strong>Clear All</strong> to clear styling for all fields.</p>
